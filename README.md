# wireframing.

Wire framing functions as a blueprint or skeletal framework for a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without going into detail about design elements like colours, fonts, or images.

## Key Elements in a Wireframe

Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.


## Types of Wireframes.
Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

## Type of wireframe

## Wireframing in Figma
Figma is browser-based, so sharing your wireframes is as easy as sharing a link. Your team can leave comments right on the file so you can easily get feedback and field questions.


## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development

Wireframing is an important step in the software development process. It creates a visual blueprint of the user interface, allowing developers, designers, and stakeholders to agree on the structure and flow of an application before writing any code.

Wireframes aid in development by clarifying functionality and layout, guiding design and development, identifying usability issues, and facilitating effective communication among team members.

Finally, wireframing ensures that everyone is on the same page, leading to a more focused, user-centred, and efficient development process.
